# üìö Quotes Explorer

**Quotes Explorer** is a semantic quote search app that allows users to find meaningful quotes using advanced Natural Language Processing techniques. Instead of relying on keyword matches, it understands the **context** of your query using **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** embeddings and **FAISS** for fast similarity search. The frontend is built using **Gradio**, offering a clean and interactive user interface.
